## ✉️ Notifications & Emails (General)
- Emails are sent from backend (interview scheduling & selection notification).
- UI should show:
  - API call results (sent/failed)
  - Detailed failure reasons (from `results.failed` items) where possible
- Confirmations: use modal + toast pattern before sending bulk emails

---

## ✅ Error handling & UX conventions
- Consistent error toast for server errors.
- Field-level validation messages for forms.
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive/bulk actions.
- Show per-item results for batch operations (not just aggregate success).

---

## 💡 Extras / Recommendations (optional but useful)
- Add CSV import for batch selection (upload IDs) — server-side support already discussed.
- Add a "Retry Failed Sends" action in Selected Candidates.
- Rate-limit bulk email button to prevent accidental spam.
- Add activity logs for actions like "Selection email sent" / "Interview scheduled"

---

If you want, I can:
- Produce a compact Postman collection or JSON endpoints doc to hand off to your frontend dev ✅  
- Or generate wireframe sketches (descriptions) for key screens (Selected Candidates modal, Schedule modal, Job Analysis dashboard) 💡

Which would you like me to deliver next?
